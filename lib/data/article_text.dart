  "FBLA Relocates Headquarters to Reston, Virginia":
      """Reston, Virginia, Oct. 19, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Future Business Leaders of America, Inc. (FBLA), the nation’s largest business Career and Technical Student Organization, announced today that it has sold its headquarters building at 1912 Association Drive and is relocating in Reston, Virginia.

The new National Service Center, which includes leased office space in Reston Town Center West, will provide convenient access to public transportation, airports, and the nation's capital for various educational activities such as national officer training and volunteer leadership meetings.

“The sale of 1912 Association Drive is an example of how we are putting the F and B back in FBLA.  Converting an underutilized real estate asset into mission-focused financial resources is how we are putting the business back in FBLA,” President and CEO Alexander T. Graham said. “With the recent launch of our new brand, now is the perfect time to look to the future of the association with a new, streamlined location where we can focus on serving our student members and the educators who support them.”

As it looks forward, FBLA is also honoring the past of the 1912 Association Drive building, which has housed its headquarters since 1992. The association will preserve legacies that have been a staple of its history in the new location.

FBLA will lease temporary space in Reston Town Center West while its new office space is completed. This process is expected to last six to nine months. Beginning November 1, mail can be sent to FBLA's new permanent address at 12100 Sunset Hills Drive, Suite 200, Reston, VA 20190. FBLA phone numbers will remain the same.""",
  "March Washington FBLA Chapter of the Month - Marysville-Getchell HS":
      """Congratulations to MARYSVILLE-GETCHELL HIGH SCHOOL for being WA FBLA's March Chapter of the Month!

Marysville Getchell FBLA Chapter has been committed to its members' success and wellbeing. Recognizing students' struggles with a lack of socialization in the virtual environment, they held numerous socials and game nights to engage their members. To continue their usual strong bond, they included fun icebreakers in their virtual social calls, focusing on members' mental health by creating designated times just to hang out! Marysville Getchell's extraordinary chapter also continued in engaging in a myriad of FBLA's programs! They've completed both Super Sweeps and Non-Stop November this year. Additionally, they've focused on engaging as many members as possible in completing the Chapter Challenges and BAAs. In order to network with other members and prepare for their future careers, Marysville Getchell FBLA even met with another local chapter, a national March of Dimes representative, and several alumni!

This year Marysville Getchell took an innovative approach to their commitment to community service! They completed extensive research to develop a contactless, COVID-safe project to serve their community. The officer team worked to plan a collection drive for their local foster care center, where members and the community could drop off items. Additionally, their chapter members worked together to write thank you notes to their local fire station. Marysville Getchell has shown that their chapter is committed to helping and positively impacting their community.

Marysville Getchell is a chapter brilliantly innovated to overcome the challenges of the virtual environment. They've focused on their members' wellbeing and success throughout the year. WAFBLA is proud to award Marysville Getchell FBLA Chapter of the Month.""",
