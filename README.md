# FBLA Mobile Application

This is the documentation for the school planner application for FBLA Mobile App Development 2022-2023. This application was created by the following students: Rohit Karthik, Farzad Hasan, and Mitra.

## Technologies Used

This application uses the Dart programming language and the Flutter mobile app development framework. It also uses Firebase to store photos and user data. External libraries used include the Flutter OpenStreetMap API, Flutter Calendar View, BCrypt (for password encryption), and the Firebase APIs.

## Application Features

This application features a page for viewing events set up by school administration, a calendar page for students to track their own tasks, a photo share for people to share things they saw with everyone else at the school, and an absences page for reporting that a student was absent or late.

The application also has two other pages; one is a bus routes page that features a map view of the different bus routes that are avaiable for studnets, and the other is a club news page that shares different news stories about clubs at the school.
